# Kukulkan
The Mayan god Kukulkan has sent his alien minions to take over the earth. You are the last person alive, stuck at the top of a temple...good thing you have your trusty laser cannon!

### Gameplay
Aliens will walk from the edges of the screen up the temple. The game ends if any of them touch you. You can blast them with your laser cannon though - hold the left or right arrow key to charge up your gun, then release to fire the shot. The longer you hold the key, the more powerful the shot.

### MVPs
* Page renders with styled background and contact information
* Game renders player, temple, aliens, and gun fire
* Gunshots will charge and fire as the left or right arrow key is pressed
* Aliens will move from the edges of the screen up the temple steps
* Contact of an alien-player will end the game
* Contact of gunfire with alien will destroy the alien
* Alien rate, strength, and speed will increase over time

### Credit
Kukulkan is heavily based on the iOS game [ZiGGURAT][ziggurat_wiki] by [Action Button Entertainment][abe_wiki].

The name [Kukulkan][kukulkan_wiki] is the Mayan feathered serpent god, from which the aliens in this game take their form. The name is also a callout to the original game, as ziggurats are one name for the classic Mesoamerican stepped pyramid.
