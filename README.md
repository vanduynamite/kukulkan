# Kukulkan
The Mayan god Kukulkan has sent his alien minions to take over the earth! You are the last person alive, and stuck at the top of a pyramid. Good thing you have your trusty laser cannon!

### Gameplay
Aliens will walk from the edges of the screen up the pyramid. The game ends if any of them touch you. You can blast them with your laser cannon though - hold the left or right arrow key to charge up your gun, then release to fire the shot. The longer you hold the key, the more powerful the shot.

### Credit
Kukulkan is heavily based on the iOS game [ZiGGURAT][ziggurat_wiki] by [Action Button Entertainment][abe_wiki].

The name [Kukulkan][kukulkan_wiki] is the Mayan feathered serpent god, from which the aliens in this game take their form. The name is also a callout to the original game, as ziggurats are one name for the classic Mesoamerican stepped pyramid.
